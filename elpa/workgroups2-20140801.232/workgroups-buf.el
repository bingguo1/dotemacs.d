;; BUFFER is the most low level part Workgroups operates with (except
;; serializing Emacs objects functions).
;;
;; Different buffers we have:
;;  - live buffers     (just switch-to them)
;;  - files/dirs       (open them)
;;  - special buffers  (shells, unknown modes - write support for them)
;;
;; Another different types of "buffers":
;;  - standard Emacs buffer (as you know it)
;;  - Workgroups Buffer object (Elisp object, a representation of Emacs buffer)
