;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Workgroups2 is an Emacs session manager. It is based on the
;; experimental branch of the original "workgroups" extension.
;;
;; If you find a bug - please post it here:
;; https://github.com/pashinin/workgroups2/issues
;;
;;
;; Install
;; ----------------------
;; See the README.md file at: https://github.com/pashinin/workgroups2
;; Add the lines below to your .emacs configuration.
;;
;; (require 'workgroups2)
;;
;; <settings here>
;;
;; (workgroups-mode 1)  ; put this one at the bottom of .emacs
;;
;;
;; Configure
;; ----------------------
;; ;; Change prefix key (before activating WG)
;; (setq wg-prefix-key (kbd "C-c z"))
;;
;; ;; Change workgroups session file
;; (setq wg-session-file "~/.emacs.d/.emacs_workgroups"
;;
;; ;; Set your own keyboard shortcuts to reload/save/switch WG:
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<pause>")     'wg-reload-session)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-<pause>") 'wg-save-session)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "s-z")         'wg-switch-to-workgroup)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "s-/")         'wg-switch-to-previous-workgroup)
;;
;;
;; Use
;; ----------------------
;; Most commands start with prefix `wg-prefix-key'.
;; You can change it before activating workgroups.
;; By default prefix is: "C-c z"
;;
;; <prefix> <key>
;;
;; <prefix> c    - create workgroup
;; <prefix> A    - rename workgroup
;; <prefix> k    - kill workgroup
;; <prefix> v    - switch to workgroup
;; <prefix> C-s  - save session
;; <prefix> C-f  - load session
;;
;;
;; Help
;; ----------------------
;; Type "<prefix> ?" for more help
