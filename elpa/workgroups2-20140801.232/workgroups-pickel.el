;;; workgroups-pickel.el --- Elisp object serdes used by Workgroups
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Workgroups allows you to serialize some objects, even such as buffers
;; (that are displayed as #<object>). The only trick is to write
;; functions that extract enough information about an object and
;; functions that can recreate an object.
;;
;; Main functions are: `wg-pickel', `wg-pickel-to-string', `wg-pickel-to-file'
;; What objects are supported? See `wg-pickel-pickelable-types'
;;
