;; FIXME:
;;
;; Only set `wg-workgroup-base-wconfig' on `wg-write-session-file' or
;; `delete-frame' and only with the most recently changed working-wconfig.
;; Then, since it's not overwritten on every call to
;; `wg-workgroup-working-wconfig', its restoration can be retried after manually
;; recreating buffers that couldn't be restored.  So it takes over the
;; 'incorrect restoration' portion of the base wconfig's duty.  All that leaves
;; to base wconfigs is that they're a saved wconfig the user felt was important.
;; So why not allow more of of them?  A workgroup could stash an unlimited
;; number of wconfigs.
;;
;; TODO:
;;
;;   * Write new commands for restoring stashed wconfigs
;;
;;   * Add this message on improper restoration of `base-wconfig':
;;
;;       "Unable to restore 'buf1', 'buf2'... Hit C-whatever to retry after
;;        manually recreating these buffers."

Each entry should be a list containing an identifier symbol, a
prompt string, and a function form that's funcall'd to produce
the filtered buffer-list.

The prompt string is displayed as part of the minibuffer prompt
when its filter is active.

The function form should be either a function-symbol or a lambda, and
should take two arguments: a workgroup and a list of live Emacs
buffers.  The function should return a new list of live buffers,
typically by filtering its second argument in some way.

Default buffer-list-filters include:

`all'           All buffer names

`fallback'      A special case used to fallback to the
                original (non-ido/iswitchb) Emacs command.
                `fallback' isn't actually a buffer-list-filter
                itself, but can be used in
                `wg-buffer-list-filter-order-alist' just the
